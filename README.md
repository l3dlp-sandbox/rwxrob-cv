# Chong Ying Xiang, Curriculum Vitae

This CV is inspired and forked from [RWXRob's repo](https://github.com/rwxrob/cv).

> Content for this CV is (mostly) contained in the [data.yml](data.yml),
which can be queried, filtered, and used to generate different views.
Hence, its length and lack of specificity. Recruiters and employers
often prefer a broader view of my personal and professional life in
order to make their own decisions about which elements to focus on
rather than have me choose.
