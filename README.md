# Yingxiang Chong, Curriculum Vitae

This repo is inspired and forked from [RWXRob's repo](https://github.com/rwxrob/cv).

Find out more about me in [data.yml](data.yml).

> Content for this CV is (mostly) contained in the data.yml,
which can be queried, filtered, and used to generate different views.
Hence, its length and lack of specificity. Recruiters and employers
often prefer a broader view of my personal and professional life in
order to make their own decisions about which elements to focus on
rather than have me choose.
